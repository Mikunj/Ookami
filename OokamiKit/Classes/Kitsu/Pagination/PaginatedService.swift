///
/// How this works is that it will first fetch objects through the request passed in.
/// There after it will use the links provided from the response to preform the rest of the fetches.
/// If at any point a request fails, then the current link state will not be overriden.
///
/// E.g nextLink = 5, base.next() -> fails, nextLink will still be 5, thus calling next again will try perform the request again
